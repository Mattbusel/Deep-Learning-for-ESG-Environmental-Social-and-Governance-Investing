1. Data Acquisition & Preprocessing:

Sources:
ESG: Boxes for MSCI, Sustainalytics, Bloomberg, Company Reports, NGO Reports, News Articles. Arrows pointing to a "Data Lake" box.
Financial: Boxes for Yahoo Finance, Quandl, Intrinio. Arrows pointing to the "Data Lake".
Tools:
Web scraping tools/APIs (if needed) with arrows pointing to the various data source boxes.
Hugging Face Transformers box with arrows going to "News Articles", "NGO Reports", and "Company Reports" for NLP tasks (sentiment analysis, topic modeling).
Python with Pandas/Scikit-learn box for data cleaning, normalization, and structuring (arrows connecting to "Data Lake").
2. Deep Learning Model Development:

Framework: A big box for PyTorch.
Model Architecture: Boxes for RNNs, CNNs, with arrows pointing to "PyTorch".
Feature Engineering: A box with arrows coming from "Data Lake" and pointing to the model architecture boxes. This box would include techniques like sentiment scores, ESG risk scores, etc.
Training: A box with arrows from "Feature Engineering" and "PyTorch" pointing to it. This box could include elements like "Hyperparameter Tuning," "Loss Function," and "Optimizer."
3. Evaluation & Interpretation:

Metrics: A box with items like "Accuracy," "Precision/Recall," "F1-Score," "AUC." Arrows pointing from "Training" to this box.
Interpretability: A box with "SHAP (SHapley Additive exPlanations)" and "Attention Mechanisms." Arrows from "Deep Learning Model" to this box.
4. Application (Optional):

Portfolio Construction: A box with arrows from "Deep Learning Model" and "Financial Data" pointing to it.
Risk Management: A box with arrows from "Deep Learning Model" and "ESG Data" pointing to it.
Visualization: A box with tools like Tableau, matplotlib, or Plotly, with arrows from all other sections pointing to it.
Connecting the Sections:

Arrows would flow from "Data Acquisition & Preprocessing" to "Deep Learning Model Development" to "Evaluation & Interpretation."
Dotted arrows would go from "Evaluation & Interpretation" back to "Deep Learning Model Development" and even "Data Acquisition & Preprocessing" to indicate potential iterations and refinements.
Arrows from "Evaluation & Interpretation" would also go to "Application" to show how the model's insights are used.
